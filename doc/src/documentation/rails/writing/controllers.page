h2. RSpec on Rails - Specifying Controllers

Controller Specs live in ~/spec/controllers/.

RSpec on Rails 0.7.0 introduces the ability to specify your controllers in complete
isolation from their related views and nearly complete isolation from the database
as well.

Isolation from views is supported implicitly by controller specs themselves. If
you prefer to integrate views (a la rails functional testing) you can by including
the keyword/commmand "integrate_views".

Isolation from the database is not complete if you are using active_record models,
but you can use mocks and stubs at the class level to intercept calls
like <code>:find</code>, <code>:create</code> and even <code>:new</code>
to introduce mock instances instead of real active_record instances.
