== Building the RSpec gem ==
rake gem
gem install pkg/rspec-0.x.x.gem (you may have to sudo)

== Running the specs ==
In order to run RSpec's full suite of specs (rake pre_commit) you must install the following gems:

* rake          # Runs the build script
* rcov          # Verifies that the code is 100% covered by specs
* webgen        # Generates the static HTML website
* RedCloth      # Required by webgen
* syntax        # Required by our own custom webgen extension to highlight ruby code
* diff-lcs      # Required if you use the --diff switch
* win32console  # Required by the --colour switch if you're on Windows
* meta_project  # Required in order to make releases at RubyForge
* sqlite3-ruby  # Required by RSpec on Rails specs
* ZenTest       # Required by RSpec on Rails specs
* Rails         # Required by RSpec on Rails specs

You must also install SQLite - which is needed to test the Rails plugin.

Note that RSpec itself - once built - doesn't have any dependencies outside the Ruby core 
and stdlib - with a few exceptions:

* The spec command line uses diff-lcs when --diff is specified.
* The Spec::Rake::SpecTask needs RCov if RCov is enabled in the task.
* RSpec on Rails needs the ZenTest gem to be installed (and Rails and its dependencies of course)

See http://rspec.rubyforge.org for further documentation.
