h2. Rake Task

RSpec comes with a Rake task for executing specs.
See "Spec::Rake::SpecTask":../rdoc/classes/Spec/Rake/SpecTask.html for details.

h3. Run specs

<ruby file="../test/tasks/examples.rake"/>

Also see the "RCov":rcov.html page for info about how to generate a coverage report.

h3. Generate specdocs in RDoc format

<ruby file="../test/tasks/examples_specdoc.rake"/>

This will write the specdocs to a file, which can be included in your RDoc. 
Just like "this":../rdoc/files/EXAMPLES_rd.html.

h3. Generate HTML report

<ruby file="../test/tasks/failing_examples_with_html.rake"/>

This will write a HTML file that looks like "this":failing_examples.html.
