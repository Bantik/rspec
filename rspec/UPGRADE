= Upgrading existing code to RSpec-0.9

=== New Syntax for should and should_not

* Use translator (should get 90% of your code)
* Manually fix "parenthesis" warnings

=== Change before_context_eval to before_eval

before_context_eval is an un-published hook used by
Spec::Rails to create specialized behaviour contexts.
Most of you don't need to change this, but for those
who have exploited it, you'll need to change it to
before_eval.
