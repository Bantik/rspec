== Demo app for RSpec on Rails
TODO: move this to generator README


This directory contains a demo app for RSpec on Rails.
The actual plugin lives under vendor/plugins/rspec_on_rails

In order to run RSpec against this app, you need:
* Ruby on Rails 1.1.2 or later
* SQlite3
* The sqlite3-ruby gem

Once all of this is installed, install the helper and rake tasks:

  ruby script/generate rspec

Now you should have the following files:

 * spec/spec_helper.rb
 * lib/tasks/rspec.rake
 * vendor/generator/rspec_model
 * vendor/generator/rspec_controller
 * vendor/generator/rspec_integration

(Note that in the demo project, these generated files are ignored - since
they are intended to be generated over again when changes are made.
For other rails apps, these files should be checked into the SCM).

From this point, when you want to generate models and controllers, you
should use generate rspec_model instead of generate model. You will get the same
production files as if you were running without rspec, but instead of
getting test/unit/*_test.rb and test/functional/*_test.rb files you'll
be getting spec/model/*_spec.rb and test/controller/*_spec.rb files.
And fixtures will be generated under spec/fixtures/*.yml

To run the specs, just run

  rake spec

or to run model or controller specs only:

  rake spec:model
  rake spec:controller
