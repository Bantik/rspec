Here's what needs to happen vis a vis the rails plugin before the 0.8.0 release.

== should render
handle the other should_render possibilities
match regexps on should render_text

===========
note: previously we used should_render :key => value, where :key might be
:template, :text or :action. The matcher syntax separates them to avoid conflict
with the render method (used in view specs.)

Question: it now supports render_template and render_text. Do we need to
support render_action? Or is that something that really shouldn't even
be spec'able?

Rails only supports assert_template - it doesn't even support assert_text!
