h2. Introduction to Writing Specs using RSpec on Rails

RSpec on Rails 0.7.0 supports 4 different types of specs:


* "Model Specs":models.html
* "View Specs":views.html
* "Controller Specs":controllers.html
* "Helper Specs":helpers.html

Each of these use slightly different Context classes to give you access
to the appropriate services and methods. The type of Context is determined
implicitly by placing the spec within a named directory tree:

<pre>
../spec/controllers/**/*_spec.rb
../spec/helpers/**/*_spec.rb
../spec/models/**/*_spec.rb
../spec/views/**/*_spec.rb
</pre>
