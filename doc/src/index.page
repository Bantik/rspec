h2. Overview

RSpec is a framework that provides programmers with a Domain Specific
Language to describe the behaviour of Ruby code with readable,
executable examples that guide you in the design process and
serve well as both documentation and tests.

h2. Here is how you do it

<notextile>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
<p>
  Start with a very simple example that expresses
  some basic desired behaviour.
</p>
<ruby>
# game_spec.rb
require 'game'

describe Game do
  before(:each) do
    @game = Game.new
  end

  it "should score 0 for gutter game" do
    1.upto(20) { @game.hit(0) }
    @game.score.should == 0
  end
end
</ruby>
<p>
  Run the example and watch it fail.
</p>
<pre style="color:red;">$ spec game_spec.rb 
./game_spec.rb:3:
  uninitialized constant Game
</pre>
    </td>
    <td width="50%">
<p>
  Now write
  just enough code to make it pass.
</p>
<ruby>
# game.rb
class Game
  def hit(pins)
  end

  def score
    0
  end
end
</ruby>
<p>
Run the example and bask in the joy that is green.
</p>

<pre style="color:green;">$ spec game_spec.rb --format specdoc

Game
- should score 0 for gutter game

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</notextile>

h2. Take very small steps

Don't rush ahead with more code. Instead, add another
example and let it guide you to what you have
to do next. And don't forget to take time
to refactor your code before it gets messy. You should keep
your code clean at every step of the way.
