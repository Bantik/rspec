This directory contains the sources for RSpec on Rails,
which is a set of extensions to RSpec to port fixtures
and other common Rails testing features to RSpec.

There is also a set of generators for setting up a Rails
project for RSpec and generate spec skeletons.

Please refer to the Documentation on the website:

http://rspec.rubyforge.org/tools/rails/

Or if you've checked this out from Subversion, also
read the README under the rails app for instructions
on how to run from source.

RSpec on Rails is licensed under the same license as RSpec itself,
the MIT-LICENSE. See http://rspec.rubyforge.org/license.html.
