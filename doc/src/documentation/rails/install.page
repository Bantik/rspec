h2. RSpec on Rails - Installation

h3. Pre-Installation
You'll have to install the RSpec core gem first:

<pre>
gem install rspec
</pre>

Take note of what rspec version you're installing - it's very important that you
install a compatible RSpec on Rails plugin.

h3. Installation

RSpec on Rails is a regular Rails plugin. It can be installed via your Rails app's script/plugin tool.
In the examples below - make sure you replace TAG with the version of the plugin you want to install.
It's important that the REL_X_Y_Z corresponds to the version of RSpec core you have installed - for example
REL_0_5_16.

<pre>
ruby script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_X_Y_Z/vendor/rspec_on_rails/vendor/plugins/rspec
</pre>

Or if you like to live dangerously you can get the HEAD of the trunk:

<pre>
ruby script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/trunk/vendor/rspec_on_rails/vendor/plugins/rspec
</pre>

If your own project is in Subversion and you'd like RSpec on Rails to always follow HEAD, install with -x:

<pre>
ruby script/plugin install -x svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/trunk/vendor/rspec_on_rails/vendor/plugins/rspec
</pre>

Once the plugin is installed, you must bootstrap your Rails app with RSpec. Stand in the root of your Rails app and run:

<pre>
ruby script/generate rspec
</pre>

This will generate the various files needed to use RSpec with Rails.
