= RSpec - Behaviour Specification Framework for Ruby

RSpec is a behaviour specification framework for Ruby.  RSpec was created in
response to Dave Astels' article _A New Look at Test Driven Development_ which
can be read at: http://daveastels.com/index.php?p=5  RSpec is intended to
provide the features discussed in Dave's article.

RSpec was first explored by Steven Baker <srbaker@pobox.com> and Gabriel
Bauman <gbauman@gmail.com>, and has since received numerous contributions
from Dave himself as well as Aslak Hellesoy.

== Download/Installation

=== Using RubyGems

  $ sudo gem install rspec

=== Getting the latest sources

RSpec was previously hosted under the Monotone distributed version control system.  Due to the increasing popularity of RSpec, and the fact that a large part of the world hasn't yet discovered how wonderful Monotone is, we have succumbed to peer pressure and moved the repository to Subversion.

RSpec's repository is located at svn://svn.behaviourdriven.org/rspec

== Creating a Gem

If you have checked out the sources from version control, you can create a Gem from the checked out version with the 'gem' rake task, like so:

  $ rake gem

This will create a gem in the pkg/ subdirectory.  To install the created gem, simply run 'gem install' as root (preferably using sudo(1)):

  $ sudo gem install pkg/rspec_x.y.z.gem

Please visit the RSpec web site periodically, it will be updated with more information as it is made available including documentation, mailing lists, bug tracking, and more. Special thanks to RubyForge for hosting the project site.

== Usage

This will also install a new executable for you, 'spec'. Now you can

  spec movie_spec.rb
  spec *_spec.rb
