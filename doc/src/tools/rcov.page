h2. RCov

RSpec has tight integration with <a href="http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?rcov=">RCov</a>. If you have RCov installed you can
use the rake task to generate a coverage report. See the <a href="../rake.html">Rake</a> for details.

h3. Coverage threshold

You can guard your codebase's coveraqge from dropping by adding the RCovVerify
task to your Rakefile:

<ruby file="../test/tasks/rcov_verify.rake"/>

This will give you a :rcov_verify task that will fail your build if the
coverage is below the threshold you define (the higher the better).
