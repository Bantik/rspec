h2. RSpec on Rails - Installation

RSpec on Rails is a standard Rails plugin that can be installed with Rails' familiar <tt>script/plugin</tt> tool.

h3. Installation of a stable release

You'll have to install the RSpec gem first:

<pre>
gem install rspec (mac/linux users use sudo)
</pre>

Take note of what RSpec version you're installing - it's very important that you
install a compatible RSpec on Rails plugin. (You can pass -v X.Y.Z to the gem command to install a particular version).

Now, install the plugin:

<pre>
ruby script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_X_Y_Z/rspec_on_rails/vendor/plugins/rspec_on_rails
</pre>

That works for everything back to 0.7.5 (i.e. REL_0_7_5). Versions before 0.7.5 had a different path:

<pre>
ruby script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_X_Y_Z/vendor/rspec_on_rails
</pre>

h3. Installation of trunk HEAD

If you prefer to live dangerously you can get the HEAD of the trunk. If you do this, you must also install RSpec itself
as a Rails plugin:

<pre>
ruby script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/trunk/rspec
ruby script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/trunk/rspec_on_rails/vendor/plugins/rspec_on_rails
</pre>

If your own project is in Subversion and you'd like RSpec on Rails to always follow HEAD, install with -x:

<pre>
ruby script/plugin install -x svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/trunk/rspec
ruby script/plugin install -x svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/trunk/rspec_on_rails/vendor/plugin/rspec_on_rails
</pre>

Note that if you want to use the <tt>spec</tt> command directly (as opposed to the spec:* tasks), you must type
the full path to your RSpec plugin's spec command. For example:

<pre>
ruby vendor/plugins/rspec/bin/spec spec/models/foo_spec.rb
</pre>

h3. Bootstrapping

Once the plugin is installed, you must bootstrap your Rails app with RSpec. Stand in the root of your Rails app and run:

<pre>
ruby script/generate rspec
</pre>

This will generate the various files needed to use RSpec with Rails and install RSpec Rake tasks.
