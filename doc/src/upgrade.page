h2. Upgrading to RSpec 0.9

RSpec 0.9 removes all of the features that were deprecated in 0.8.

In order to ease the transition from 0.8 to 0.9, we have included a
tool to translate your 0.8 style specs to 0.9 style. After installing
the 0.9 gem, you should run:

<pre>
spec_translator path_to_my_spec_dir path_to_my_translated_spec_dir
</pre>

(or alternatively, if you have your code under version control and can
do a revert if things go wrong:)

<pre>
spec_translator path_to_my_spec_dir path_to_my_spec_dir
</pre>

(This will translate your specs in-place)

h2. Spec::Rails

Rails users must update spec_helper.rb and assorted commands in the scripts directory.
To do so, execute the following command:

<pre>
script/generate rspec
</pre>

For convenience, we have also made the translator available as a Rake task:

<pre>
rake spec:translate
</pre>
