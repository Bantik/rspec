h2. RSpec on Rails - Generators

RSpec on Rails contains generators that you can use to generate models and controllers 
in a similar fashion to Rails' builtin generators, but will generate specs instead of tests
and will put fixtures under the spec folder. Example:

<pre>
ruby script/generate rspec_model person
</pre>

or

<pre>
ruby script/generate rspec_controller person
</pre>

For more information on each generator, just run them without any arguments.
