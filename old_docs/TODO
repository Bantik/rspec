 - Rakefile should have an install target.
 - Spec CLI needs to have a way to specify a runner.
 - Rake tasks for spec running (see TestTask).
 - Write specifications for the spec CLI.
 - Avoid using both the 'rspec' and 'spec' names in sources and doco. It's confusing. Consider how to align with Dan North's JBehave effort in terms of name and vocabulary (AH).
 - Decide whether mocks should expect messages in a particular order or not. -Or make it configurable. Ex: mock("foo", :order => "strict") (AH).
 - Do we want to use an issue tracker? The one at RubyForge maybe?
 - Create first class result objects instead of just Strings. This can be used to generate XML/YAML reports
   which in turn can be transformed to e.g. HTML reports.

Aslak/Brian:
should.raise should be more descriptive when it fails - show the code maybe?
topic, not context

topic 'lunch' do
  topic 'bad lunch' do
    
  end
end

A specification describes a correct program
A test helps provoke a good program
