h2. RSpec on Rails - Overview

A Rails plugin that brings RSpec to Rails.

h3. Features

* Use RSpec to independently specify models, views, controllers and helpers
* Integrated fixture loading
* Special generators for models and controllers that generate specs instead of tests.

h3. Naming conventions

For clarity and consistency, RSpec uses a slightly different naming convention
for directories and Rake tasks than what you get from the Test::Unit testing built into rails.

* model specs under spec/models
* controller specs under spec/controllers
* view specs under spec/views
* helper specs under spec/helpers

The Rake tasks are named accordingly.
