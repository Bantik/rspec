h2. Upgrading from 0.8 specs

In order to ease the transition from 0.8 style specs to the current style (introduced
in 0.9), we have included a translator to automate this translation. 

The translator is not perfect, but we feel it's "good enough". It will
translate roughly 95% or more of your specs correctly, and you should
expect some manual work. Make sure all of your examples are green before
you run it!

After installing the gem, you should run:

<pre>
spec_translator path_to_my_spec_dir path_to_my_translated_spec_dir
</pre>

(or alternatively, if you have your code under version control and can
do a revert if things go wrong:)

<pre>
spec_translator path_to_my_spec_dir path_to_my_spec_dir
</pre>

(This will translate your specs in-place)

h2. Spec::Rails

Rails users must update spec_helper.rb and assorted commands in the scripts directory.
To do so, execute the following command:

<pre>
script/generate rspec
</pre>

For convenience, we have also made the translator available as a Rake task:

<pre>
rake spec:translate
</pre>
