In order to run RSpec's tests and generate the website, you must have RubyGems.
Then you must install the following gems:

* rake
* rcov
* RubyInline
* ParseTree   (Ignore the message: test/test_parse_tree.rb:190:38: ':' not followed by identified or operator)
* webgen
* RedCloth
* syntax

Note that RSpec itself - once built - doesn't have any dependencies outside the Ruby core 
and stdlib - with a few exceptions:
* test2spec uses RubyInline, RubyToC and ParseTree
* The spectask needs rcov if rcov is enabled.

See http://rspec.rubyforge.org for further documentation.
