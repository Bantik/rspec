h2. TextMate

TextMate is a popular text editor for OS X. RSpec's TextMate bundle has a big number of snippets for
all of RSpec's expectations, contexts and specify's. You can even run specs from TextMate using
CMD-R and CMD-SHIFT-R - and you'll see a nice progress bar while the specs are running (except
usually they run so fast you won't be able to see it move).

If you select one or more directories or files you can run those too with CMD-R (but you have to have 
an arbitrary Ruby file open to make this work).

h2. Installation

There are several ways to install the RSpec bundle for TextMate. We'll start by the easiest.

h3. Installing from RubyForge.

Just download the tgz file from RubyForge, unpack it and double-click the RSpec.tmbundle icon.
It is very important that your installed Ruby gem is a compatible version.

h3. Installing from trunk HEAD in subversion

Get the source via subversion to some location on your drive:

<pre>
svn co svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/trunk/RSpec.tmbundle path/to/RSpec.tmbundle
</pre>

(If you have RSpec checked out you don't need this - it's under vendor/RSpec.tmbundle).

Now, make a symbolic link from TextMate's bundle directory to your working copy of the bundle:

<pre>
ln -s path/to/RSpec.tmbundle ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/RSpec.tmbundle
</pre>

Of course, the last step is not necessary if you check the bundle out straight into the TextMate directory.

h3. Pointing to the right Ruby and RSpec.

You may need to adjust the PATH in your <tt>~/.MacOSX/environment.plist</tt> file. For example:

<pre>
<key>PATH</key>
<string>/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:/opt/local/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin</string>
</pre>

You may also have to set your <tt>TM_RUBY</tt> environment variable in TextMate's preferences to point to your ruby executable.

You can tell RSpec.tmbundle to use a particular RSpec at a particular location on your filesystem.
You probably want to do this if you run the bundle off trunk HEAD.
Just define the <tt>TM_RSPEC_HOME</tt> environment variable in TextMate's preferences. This should
point to the root directory of your working copy of RSpec (where you checked out RSpec core).

h3. Setting RSpec command line options

You can specify these in the <tt>TM_RSPEC_OPTS</tt> environment variable in TextMate's preferences.
