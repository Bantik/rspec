Helper Examples live in $RAILS_ROOT/spec/helpers/.

Writing specs for your helpers is a snap. Just tell the context the name of the
helper ...

<coderay>
describe RegistrationHelper do
  ...
end
</coderay>

... and then you can reference the methods directly because they are actually included
in the specs!
