Here is an example of a spec for a Stack. We start with a group of shared examples.
These won't get run directly, but can be included by, and run in the context of
other example groups.

<ruby file="../rspec/examples/pure/shared_stack_examples.rb" />

And here is the group that runs them. Note the nesting, which is a new feature in
RSpec 1.1.

<ruby file="../rspec/examples/pure/stack_spec_with_nested_example_groups.rb" />

And here is what you see when you run these examples in TextMate:
