    <h2>Contribute to RSpec</h2>


	<p>There are several ways in which you can contribute to RSpec.</p>


	<h2>Mailing Lists</h2>


	<p>One easy way you can contribute is to join and participate in our mailing lists:</p>


	<p><a href="http://rubyforge.org/mail/?group_id=797">http://rubyforge.org/mail/?group_id=797</a></p>


	<ul>
	<li>rspec-users is for anyone who use RSpec to discuss any topics related to
the use of the tools</li>
		<li>rspec-devel is for those interested in the ongoing development of RSpec and
those who wish to make personal contributions</li>
	</ul>


	<p>While we don&#8217;t wish to restrict the content on either list, we do ask that
off topic posts are so marked ([OT] in the subject line).</p>


	<p>Also, please use the tracker to submit Requests For Enhancement (see below), not
the mailing lists. While we&#8217;re happy to engage in conversation about ongoing
development, we&#8217;re not always available, in town, on line, etc and the best
way to ensure that your concerns stay on our radar is to put them in the
tracker, which we review regularly.</p>


	<h2>Requests For Enhancement (RFEs)</h2>


	<p>Please use the tracker for all RFEs.</p>


	<p>For Feature Requests, Patches and Bugs, please be sure to select the appropriate
category (expectations, mocks, runner, rails plugin, or RSpec.tmbundle)</p>


	<p><a href="http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?group_id=797">RubyForge tracker</a></p>


	<p>Wherever feasible, please please please submit a complete spec we can run &#8211; something like:</p>


<pre class="ruby"><code><span class="ident">describe</span> <span class="punct">&quot;</span><span class="string">My Problem</span><span class="punct">&quot;</span> <span class="keyword">do</span>
  <span class="ident">it</span> <span class="punct">&quot;</span><span class="string">can be reproduced as follows</span><span class="punct">&quot;</span> <span class="keyword">do</span>
    <span class="comment"># Why doesn't this work?</span>
    <span class="comment"># (This is just a silly example)</span>
    <span class="constant">true</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">should</span> <span class="ident">be_true</span>
  <span class="keyword">end</span>
<span class="keyword">end</span>
</code></pre>

	<p>This will make us more likely to look at it quickly.</p>


	<h3>Feature Requests</h3>


	<p>Interested in a new feature that you would find useful but don&#8217;t wish
to develop yourself? Please submit it in a Feature Request.</p>


	<h3>Patches</h3>


	<p>Interested in a new feature that you&#8217;ve already written or want to write?
Please submit a patch, but please follow these guidelines.</p>


	<ul>
	<li>patch against svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/trunk (do not patch against a released gem)</li>
		<li>include specs!</li>
		<li>include docs!</li>
		<li>run &#8220;rake pre_commit&#8221; on your patched source</li>
		<li>create a patch with &#8220;svn diff &gt; something_rather_descriptive.diff&#8221; </li>
		<li>create a new ticket in the <a href="http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?group_id=797">RubyForge tracker</a></li>
		<li>attach the diff file to the ticket (DON&#8217;T <span class="caps">FORGET TO TICK THE CHECKBOX OR YOUR PATCH WILL GET LOST</span>)</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Bugs</h3>


	<p>We <span class="caps">LOVE</span> to hear about bugs that you find, but we can&#8217;t address them
if we can&#8217;t reproduce them. If you submit a Bug report, be sure to include:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>rspec version (either a versioned release or svn revision number)</li>
		<li>rails version (if you&#8217;re using the rspec_on_rails plugin)</li>
		<li>any other relevant versions, OSes, etc</li>
		<li>a failing spec <span class="caps">AND</span> code &#8211; we need to be able to reproduce the failure. While code snippets are better than nothing, what we really prefer is modifications to RSpec&#8217;s own specs, as a unified diff file.</li>
	</ul>
