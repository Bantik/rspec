h2. RSpec on Rails - Runners

h3. Standard spec command

<pre>
spec path/to/directory/with/specs
spec path/to/individual_spec.rb
</pre>

h3. Run specs fast with rails_spec (recommended)

Loading the entire Rails environment every time a spec is executed is quite slow.
We have therefore made a little tool that allows you to load the rails environment
once for all. Open up two shells and run the following in the first:

<pre>
script/rails_spec_server
</pre>

- And then run this in the second:

<pre>
script/rails_spec REGULAR_SPEC_OPTIONS
</pre>

The script/rails_spec script has the same command line interface as the familiar spec
command. But it's MUCH faster.

h3. Running specs with Rake

Note that the rake tasks don't use the fast rails_spec command - it uses the
standard spec. Also note that it is pre-configured to run any file that ends
in "_spec", so you'll have to either follow that convention or adjust the Rakefile.

All specs (excluding plugins) can be run with...

<pre>
rake spec
rake spec:app
</pre>

All specs including plugins can be run with...

<pre>
rake spec:all
</pre>

You can also isolate Model, Controller, View, Helper or Plugin specs with...

<pre>
rake spec:models
rake spec:controllers
rake spec:views
rake spec:helpers
rake spec:plugins
</pre>

To see all the RSpec related tasks, run

<pre>
rake --tasks spec
</pre>
