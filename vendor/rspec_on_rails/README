== Demo app for RSpec on Rails

This directory contains a demo app for RSpec on Rails.
The purpose of this app is to serve as a testbed for
RSpec on Rails. The rest of this document describes
how to verify that Rspec on Rails works as intended.

For more information, see the user docs:
http://rspec.rubyforge.org/tools/rails.html

=== Install prerequisites

  * Ruby on Rails 1.1.2 or later
  * SQlite3
  * The sqlite3-ruby gem

=== Initialize the development database

  rake migrate

=== Install the helper and rake tasks:

  ruby script/generate rspec

Now you should have the following files:

  * spec/spec_helper.rb
  * lib/tasks/rspec.rake
  * vendor/generator/rspec_model
  * vendor/generator/rspec_controller
  * vendor/generator/rspec_integration

(Note that in this demo project, these generated files are ignored by svn - since
they are intended to be generated over again when changes are made.
For other rails apps, these files should be checked into the SCM).

=== Run the specs

  rake spec

If everything passes at this point, everything is good.
