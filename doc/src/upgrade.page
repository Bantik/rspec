h2. Upgrading from RSpec 0.6.x to 0.7

We've made some significant improvements in 0.7, some of which required API changes that
will cause some existing specs to fail. Please read the following instructions before you upgrade
from 0.7.

h2. Expectations (in core)

h3. Replace "should_equal" with "should_eql"

RSpec now checks for equality in the same way that ruby does:

<ruby>
target.should_equal(expected) #object identity - delegates to target.equal?(expected)
target.should_be(expected) #alias for should_equal - left in place to ease upgrade
target.should_eql(expected) #value equivalence - delegates to target.eql?(expected)
target.should == expected #value equivalence - delegates to target == expected
</ruby>

All you need to do to your existing pre-0.7 specs is replace all of your "should_equal" expectations
with "should_eql".

You don't need to change "should_be" to "should_equal", as they now mean the same thing: Object identity

We recognize that this no longer aligns with assert_equal in Test::Unit, and this may
feel awkward for those of you experienced with either Test::Unit or previous releases
of RSpec. We chose to make this change because there was some confusion
over the meaning of should_equal and should_be and we decided that it would be less
confusing in the long run if RSpec aligns with the Ruby language.

h2. Mocks

h3. Adjust mock expectations with multiple return values

RSpec's mock framework supports setting multiple return values for a consecutive calls to single message expectation:

<ruby>
mock.should_receive(:next_value).and_return(:value1, :value2, :value3)
mock.message.next_value
=> :value1
mock.message.next_value
=> :value2
mock.message.next_value
=> :value3
</ruby>

This feature was present in previous releases, but the syntax used to be:

<ruby>
#OLD SYNTAX - DO NOT USE
mock.should_receive(:next_value).and_return([:value1, :value2, :value3])
</ruby>

This presented a problem in that you couldn't specify an Array as a return value. To fix
this one, you'll have to do a regex search for "and_return\(*\s*\[" and remove the square
brackets either by hand. You could do this with a script, but given the low usage of this
feature, we believe it will be much more efficient and less error prone to do it by hand.

h2. RSpec on Rails

h3. Add "integrate_views" to all of your controller specs using the Rails Plugin

We've enhanced rspec_on_rails to support specification of controllers and views in complete
isolation from each other. This allows you to spec your controllers before their corresponding
views exist and vice versa. It also stops errors in views from causing controller specs
to fail and vice versa.

While this is the preferred approach among hard-core BDD'ers (and TDD'ers), we recognize that
this does not align with the more high level approach supported by rails functional tests. Between
that and the desire to make upgrading to RSpec 0.7 as smooth as possible, we've included a
mechanism that will let you spec your controllers and views together.
Just add the integrate_views command to the context after the controller_name:

<ruby>
context "Given a user who is not logged in" do
  controller_name :admin
  integrate_views
  
  setup do
    ...
  end
  
  specify "an error message should be displayed when the user requests /admin/update_record"
    ...
  end
end
</ruby>

See <a href="documentation/rails/index.html">Rails Plugin</a> for more information.

h2. Change "response.should_render" to "controller.should_render"

In keeping with the separation of controllers and views, we moved should_render from the response
to the controller. This should be a simple search and replace.

<ruby>
context "..." do
  controller_name :...
  
  specify "..." do
    post 'index'
    controller.should_render :template => "index" #used to be response.should_render
  end
end
</ruby>
