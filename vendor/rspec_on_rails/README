== Demo app for RSpec on Rails

This directory contains a demo app for RSpec on Rails.
The purpose of this app is to serve as a testbed for
RSpec on Rails. The rest of this document describes
how to verify that Rspec on Rails works as intended.

For more information, see the user docs:
http://rspec.rubyforge.org/tools/rails.html

=== Install prerequisites

  * Ruby on Rails 1.1.2 or later
  * SQlite3
  * The sqlite3-ruby gem

=== Initialize the development database

  rake migrate

=== Install the helper and rake tasks:

  ruby script/generate rspec

Now you should have the following files:

  * spec/spec_helper.rb
  * lib/tasks/rspec.rake
  * vendor/generator/rspec_model
  * vendor/generator/rspec_controller
  * vendor/generator/rspec_integration

(Note that in this demo project, these generated files are ignored by svn - since
they are intended to be generated over again when changes are made.
For other rails apps, these files should be checked into the SCM).

=== Run the specs

  rake spec

If everything passes at this point, everything is good.

=== Modifying the RSpec extensions

The RSpec extensions live under vendor/generators/rspec/lib
You can modify this source code here and run the specs for the demo
app again with rake spec

=== Modifying the Generators

Whenever you make modifications to the generators, you should modify the original
code under vendor/generators/rspec/templates and run script/generate rspec
to have copies written out to vendor/generators/rspec_[controller|model]. Do
*not* modify these files directly. They are not in svn, and will be overwritten
the next time you run script/generate rspecs

There is currently no automated way to test the generators. You'll just have to play
with them and verify manually.
