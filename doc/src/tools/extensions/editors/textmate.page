h2. TextMate

TextMate is a popular text editor for OS X. RSpec's TextMate bundle 

h2. Installation

There are several ways to install the RSpec bundle for TextMate. We'll start by the easiest.

h3. Installing from RubyForge.

Just download the tgz file from RubyForge, unpack it and double-click the RSpec.tmbundle icon.
It is very important that your installed Ruby gem is a compatible version.

h3. Installing from trunk HEAD in subversion

Get the source via subversion to some location on your drive:

<code>
svn co svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/trunk/vendor/RSpec.tmbundle path/to/RSpec.tmbundle
</code>

(If you have RSpec checked out you don't need this - it's under vendor/RSpec.tmbundle)
Now, make a symbolic link from TextMate's bundle directory to your working copy of the bundle:

<code>
ln -s path/to/RSpec.tmbundle ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/RSpec.tmbundle
</code>

Of course, the last step is not necessary if you check the bundle out straight into the TextMate directory.

The last step is to set the TM_RSPEC_HOME environment variable in TextMate's preferences. This should
point to the root directory of a working copy of RSpec (trunk HEAD too).
