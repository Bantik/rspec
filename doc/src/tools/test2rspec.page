h2. Test::Unit migration

rSpec provides a tool for translating existing Test::Unit files into specifications.  Anything that cannot be converted is left in its original form.  The command line is:

<pre>
test2rspec SRC [DEST]
</pre>

If DEST is not supplied, output is sent to STDOUT. SRC and DEST can be a file or a directory.  If SRC is a directory, every test file under it will be translated.
