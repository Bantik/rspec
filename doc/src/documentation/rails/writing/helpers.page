h2. RSpec on Rails - Specifying Helpers

Helper Specs live in $RAILS_ROOT/spec/helpers/.

Writing specs for your helpers is a snap. Just tell the context the name of the
helper ...

<ruby>
context "the registration helper" do
  helper_name :registration #tells rspec to include the RegistrationHelper
  ...
</ruby>

... and then you can reference the methods directly because they are actually included
in the context!
