h2. Introduction to Writing Examples using Spec::Rails

Spec::Rails supports 4 different types of specs:

* "Model Examples":models.html
* "View Examples":views.html
* "Controller Examples":controllers.html
* "Helper Examples":helpers.html

Each of these use slightly different Context classes to give you access
to the appropriate services and methods. The type of Context is determined
implicitly by placing the spec within a named directory tree:

<pre>
spec/controllers/**/*_spec.rb
spec/helpers/**/*_spec.rb
spec/models/**/*_spec.rb
spec/views/**/*_spec.rb
</pre>
