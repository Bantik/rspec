h2. Underscore sugar

If you feel that the various dots hurt your eyes and is not very 'rubyish',
you can replace your dots with underscores, so that instead of saying

<ruby>
lambda { 1.should.not.equal 1 }.should.raise
</ruby>

you can say

<ruby>
lambda { 1.should_not_equal 1 }.should_raise
</ruby>

This applies to regular Ruby objects as well as mocks.
