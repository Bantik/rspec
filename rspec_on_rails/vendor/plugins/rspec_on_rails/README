== RSpec on Rails

RSpec on Rails (a.k.a 'spec/rails') is a Ruby on Rails plugin that allows you to drive the development
of your RoR application using RSpec, a framework that aims to enable Behaviour Driven Development
in Ruby.

== Matchers

RSpec on Rails uses a set of custom Spec::Expectations::Matchers that are specific to
Rails.

See Spec::Rails::Expectations::Matchers.

== Features

* Use RSpec to independently specify models, views, controllers and helpers
* Integrated fixture loading
* Special generators for resources, models, views and controllers that generate specs instead of tests.

== Vision

For people for whom TDD is a brand new concept, the testing support built into Ruby on Rails
is a huge leap forward. The fact that it is built right in is fantastic, and Ruby on Rails
apps are generally much easier to maintain than they might have been without such support.

For those of us coming from a history with TDD, and now BDD, the existing support presents some problems related to dependencies across specs. To that end, RSpec on Rails supports 4 types of specs. Weâ€™ve also built in first class mocking and stubbing support in order to break dependencies across these different concerns.

== Different Contexts for different Contexts

RSpec on Rails supports different Context subclasses for the following types of specs:

== Model Specs

These are the equivalent of unit tests in Rails' built in testing. Ironically (for the traditional TDD'er) these are the only specs that we feel should actually interact with the database.

== Controller Specs

These align somewhat with functional tests in rails, except that they do not actually render views (though you can force rendering of views if you prefer). Instead of setting expectations about what goes on a page, you set expectations about what templates get rendered.

== View Specs

This is the other half of Rails functional testing. View specs allow you to set up assigns and render
a template. By assigning mock model data, you can specify view behaviour with no dependency on a database
or your real models.

== Helper Specs

... let you specify directly methods that live in your helpers.
