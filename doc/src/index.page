h2. Overview

RSpec is a framework that provides programmers with a Domain Specific
Language to describe the behaviour of Ruby code with readable,
executable examples that guide you in the
design process and serve well as both documentation as tests.

h2. Here is how you do it

<notextile>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Start with a very simple spec that expresses
      some basic desired behaviour.
    </td>
    <td>
      Run the spec to see it fail, then write
      just enough code to make it pass. Don't rush
      ahead with more code, instead add another
      spec and let it guide you in what you have
      to do next. Take time every now and then
      to refactor your code when it gets messy.

    1.upto(10) { @game.hit(0) }
    @game.score.should == 0
  end

  it "should score 300 for perfect game" do
    1.upto(10) { @game.hit(10) }
    @game.score.should == 300
