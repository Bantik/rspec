This directory contains the sources for RSpec on Rails,
which is a set of extensions to RSpec to port fixtures
and other common Rails testing features to RSpec.

There is also a set of generators for setting up a Rails
project for RSpec and generate spec skeletons.

Please refer to the Documentation on the website:

http://rspec.rubyforge.org/tools/rails/

Or if you've checked this out from Subversion, also
read the README under the rails app for instructions
on how to run from source.

== License

The following license applies to the RSpec on Rails plugin,
not RSpec as a whole. We've extended ZenTest to bring you
the goodness it provides for separating out the different
kinds of specs you need for a Rails application.
