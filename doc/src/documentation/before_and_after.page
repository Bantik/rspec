h2. Before and After

h3. before(:each) and after(:each)

RSpec provides methods that let you set up and tear down state before(:each)
and after(:each) example.

<ruby>describe Account do
  before(:each) do
    @account = Account.new
  end

  it "should have a balance of $0" do
    @account.balance.should == Money.new(0)
  end
  
  after(:each) do
    @account = nil
  end
end
</ruby>

Note that after(:each) is rarely needed, and should only really be used when concerned
that some state might be leaking into your other examples.

h3. before(:all) and after(:all)

For expensive operations, like opening browsers using Spec::Ui, RSpec also allows
you to set up and tear down state before(:all) and after(:all) examples in any
given behaviour.

<ruby>describe "Search page" do
  before(:all) do
    @browser = Watir::Browser.new
  end

  it "should find all contacts" do
    ...
  end
  
  after(:all) do
    @browser.kill! rescue nil
  end
end
</ruby>

h3. %{font-weight:bold; color:red}WARNING ABOUT before(:all) and after(:all)%

It is very tempting to use before(:all) and after(:all) for situations in which it
is not appropriate. before(:all) shares some (not all) state across multiple examples. This means
that the examples become bound together, which is an absolute no-no in testing. You
should really only ever use before(:all) to set up things that are global collaborators
but not the things that you are describing in the examples.
