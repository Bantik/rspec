= RSpec Changelog

== Explanation of this file:
 
* This document should be updated for every commit.

* The first section of each version (until the lines starting with a *)
  will be used in the release notes' summary as well
  as in the news posted on rubyforge. Therefore,
  make sure it is a sentence that makes sense to the reader.
  It should summarise the release at a high level.

* Make sure the PKG_VERSION constant in Rakefile.rb is
  consistent with the latest version in this document.
