h2. RSpec on Rails - Overview

A Rails plugin that brings RSpec to Rails.

h3. Features

* Use RSpec to independently specify models, views, controllers and helpers
* Integrated fixture loading
* Special generators for models and controllers that generate specs instead of tests.

h3. Naming conventions

For clarity and consistency, RSpec uses a slightly different naming convention
for directories and Rake tasks than what you get from the Test::Unit testing built into rails.

<ruby>
project
  |
  +--app
  |
  +--components
  |
  +--...
  |
  +--spec
      |
      +-- controllers
      |
      +-- helpers
      |
      +-- models
      |
      +-- views
</ruby>

The Rake tasks are named accordingly.
