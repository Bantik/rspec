h2. RSpec on Rails - Specifying Applications at the Integration Level

Although it is part of our plan for a 1.0 release, as of release 0.7.0,
RSpec does not directly support integration spec'ing/testing.

For the time being we recommend that you use either rails integration
testing or another framework like watir or selenium.
