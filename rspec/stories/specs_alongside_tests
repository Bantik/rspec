Story: Specs alongside tests

  As an RSpec adopter with existint Test::Unit tests
  I want to run a few specs alongside my existing Test::Unit tests
  So that I can experience a smooth, gradual migration path

  Scenario: run a test with ruby
    Given the test file test/spec_and_test_together.rb
    When I run it with the ruby interpreter
    Then the exit code should be 0
    And the output should contain "1 tests, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors"

  Scenario: run a test with spec
    Given the test file test/spec_and_test_together.rb
    When I run it with the spec script
    Then the exit code should be 0
    And the output should contain "1 tests, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors"
