integration spec'ing (derived from ActionController::IntegrationTest)
resolve inconsistencies in running script/rails_spec
controller.should_not_redirect
controller.should_assign
match regexps on should_render :text => 
- right now if you fire up script/rails_spec_server and
  run 'script/rails_spec spec/helpers' twice, the first
  time they pass, the second they fail with this:
  uninitialized constant HelperEvalContextController
  
  The HelperEvalContextController class is defined in ZenTest. When
  rails_spec_server runs the 2nd time and ::Dispatcher.reset_application!
  is invoked, all previously defined controllers are undefined.
  We have to make sure HelperEvalContextController is redefined, but
  I haven't been able to do so successfully with require, require_dependency
  or load. (Aslak)
