h2. Overview

RSpec is a framework that provides programmers with a Domain Specific
Language to describe the behaviour of Ruby code with readable,
executable examples that guide you in the design process and
serve well as both documentation and tests.

h2. Here is how you do it

<notextile>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>
        Start with a very simple spec that expresses
        some basic desired behaviour.
      </p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p>
        Run the spec to see it fail, then write
        just enough code to make it pass. Don't rush
        ahead with more code, instead add another
        spec and let it guide you in what you have
        to do next. Take time every now and then
        to refactor your code when it gets messy.
