h2. RSpec on Rails - Specifying Controllers

Controller Specs live in ~/spec/controllers/.

h2. Isolation from views

RSpec on Rails 0.7.0 introduces the ability to specify your controllers in complete
isolation from their related views. This allows you to spec your controllers
before the views even exist, and will keep the specs from failing when there
are errors in your views.

h2. Optional integration with views

If you prefer to integrate views (a la rails functional testing) you can by including
the keyword/commmand "integrate_views".

<ruby>
context "a context" do
  integrate_views
  specify "something" do
    ...
  end
end
</ruby>

When you integrate views in the controller specs, you can use any of the
expectations that are specific to views as well. Read about "View Specs":views.html
to learn more.

h2. Isolation from the database

We strongly recommend that you use RSpec's "mocking/stubbing framework":../../mocks/index.html
to intercept class level calls like <code>:find</code>, <code>:create</code> and
even <code>:new</code> to introduce mock instances instead of real active_record instances.

This allows you focus your specs on the things that the controller does and not
worry about complex validations and relationships that should be spec'd in
detail in the "Model Specs":models.html

<ruby>
account = mock("account")
Account.should_receive(:find).with("37").and_return(account)
</ruby>

or

<ruby>
account = mock("account")
Account.stub!(:find).and_return(account)
</ruby>

See "Mocks and Stubs":../../mocks/index.html for more information about the
built in mocking/stubbing framework.
