h2. RSpec on Rails - Installation

h3. Pre-Installation

You'll have to install the RSpec gem first:

<pre>
gem install rspec
</pre>

Take note of what rspec version you're installing - it's very important that you
install a compatible RSpec on Rails plugin.

h3. Installation

RSpec on Rails is a standard Rails plugin. You can install it like this:

<pre>
gem install rspec -v "0.8.0" (mac users use sudo)
ruby script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_0_8_0/rspec_on_rails/vendor/plugins/rspec_on_rails
</pre>

That works for everything back to 0.7.5 (i.e. REL_0_7_5). Versions before 0.7.5 had a different path:

<pre>
gem install rspec -v ">= X.Y.Z" (mac users use sudo)
ruby script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_X_Y_Z/vendor/plugins/rspec_on_rails
</pre>

If you prefer to live dangerously you can get the HEAD of the trunk as follows (you still need to install the latest gem):

<pre>
ruby script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/trunk/rspec
ruby script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/trunk/rspec_on_rails/vendor/plugins/rspec_on_rails
</pre>

If your own project is in Subversion and you'd like RSpec on Rails to always follow HEAD, install with -x:

<pre>
ruby script/plugin install -x svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/trunk/rspec
ruby script/plugin install -x svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/trunk/rspec_on_rails/vendor/plugin/rspec_on_rails
</pre>

Once the plugin is installed, you must bootstrap your Rails app with RSpec. Stand in the root of your Rails app and run:

<pre>
ruby script/generate rspec
</pre>

This will generate the various files needed to use RSpec with Rails.
