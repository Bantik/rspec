h2. Upgrading from RSpec 0.6.x to 0.7

We've made some significant improvements in 0.7, some of which required API changes that
will cause some existing specs to fail. Please read the following instructions before you upgrade
from 0.7.

h2. Expectations (in core)

h3. <font style="color:red;">Replace should_equal and should_not_equal</font>

<ruby>
#Change this:
actual.should_equal <value>
#to this:
actual.should == <value>

#Change this:
actual.should_not_equal <value>
#to this:
actual.should_not == <value>
</ruby>

RSpec now delegates equality evaluation directly to ruby's methods and operators:

<ruby>
actual.should_equal <value> #passes if actual.equal? <value>
actual.should_not_equal <value> #passes if !actual.equal? <value>

actual.should_eql <value> #passes if actual.eql? <value>
actual.should_not_eql <value> #passes if !actual.eql? <value>

actual.should == <value> #passes if actual == <value>
actual.should_not == <value> #passes if actual != <value>
#Note: there is no support for actual.should != <value>, use actual.should_not == <value> instead
</ruby>

We recognize that this does not align with assert_equal in Test::Unit, and that this may feel awkward for those of you experienced with either Test::Unit or previous releases of RSpec. We chose to make this change because there was some confusion over the meaning of should_equal and should_be and we decided that it would be less confusing in the long run if should_equal aligns with the Ruby language.

Please see "http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Object.html#M001057":http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Object.html#M001057 for more information on the  implications of equal?, eql? and ==.

h2. Mocks

h3. <font style="color:red;">Adjust mock expectations with multiple return values</font>

RSpec's mock framework supports setting multiple return values for a consecutive calls to single message expectation:

<ruby>
mock.should_receive(:next_value).and_return(:value1, :value2, :value3)
mock.message.next_value
=> :value1
mock.message.next_value
=> :value2
mock.message.next_value
=> :value3
</ruby>

This feature was present in previous releases, but the syntax used to be:

<ruby>
#OLD SYNTAX - DO NOT USE
mock.should_receive(:next_value).and_return([:value1, :value2, :value3])
</ruby>

This presented a problem in that you couldn't specify an Array as a return value. To fix
this one, you'll have to do a regex search for "and_return\(*\s*\[" and remove the square
brackets either by hand. You could do this with a script, but given the low usage of this
feature, we believe it will be much more efficient and less error prone to do it by hand.

h2. RSpec on Rails

We've made significant improvements to the RSpec on Rails plugin. We've made an effort
to indicate below what you need to change to get your existing specs, but we may have
missed something. If you have trouble upgrading, please take a look at the "RSpec on Rails
Documentation":documentation/rails/index.html first.

If you do find the solution to your problem, whether you found it in other documentation
or devised your own solution, please submit a Documentation RFE so we can update this page:

"http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?atid=9738&group_id=797&func=browse":http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?atid=9738&group_id=797&func=browse

If you do not find a solution to your problem, please submit a Bug Report (use
"Bugs - Rails Plugin" for RSpec on Rails problems, "Bugs" for problems in core):

"http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?group_id=797":http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?group_id=797

h3. <font style="color:red;text-decoration:line-through;">gem install ZenTest</font>

%{color:red;font-weight:bold}The dependency on ZenTest is removed as of 0.7.3, however 0.7.0, 0.7.1, 0.7.2 all still need it.%

%{text-decoration:line-through}The RSpec on Rails plugin now extends, and therefore depends on, ZenTest. If you don't already have ZenTest, simply....%

<ruby>
gem install zentest -v 3.4.1
</ruby>

h3. <font style="color:red;">update spec/spec_helper.rb</font>

The new spec_helper.rb no longer mixes in the ControllerMixin. Update your spec_helper.rb
so it looks like the following, plus whatever customizations you have already made (like
fixtures or other requires, etc)

<pre>{includeFile: {filename: ../../../rspec_on_rails/vendor/plugins/rspec/generators/rspec/templates/spec_helper.rb, processOutput: false}}</pre>

You can do this automatically by re-running "script/generate rspec", but you'll overwrite your
existing spec_helper.rb and lose your customizations in doing so.

h3. <font style="color:red;">integrate_views</font>

h4. Add "integrate_views" to all of your controller specs using the Rails Plugin

We've enhanced rspec_on_rails to support specification of controllers and views in complete
isolation from each other. This allows you to spec your controllers before their corresponding
views exist and vice versa. It also stops errors in views from causing controller specs
to fail and vice versa.

While this is the preferred approach for BDD (and TDD), we recognize that
this does not align with the more high level approach supported by rails functional tests.
Between that and the desire to make upgrading to RSpec 0.7 as smooth as possible, we've included a
mechanism that will let you spec your controllers and views together.
Just add the integrate_views command to the context after the controller_name:

<ruby>
context "Given a user who is not logged in" do
  controller_name :admin
  integrate_views
  
  setup do
    ...
  end
  
  specify "an error message should be displayed when the user requests /admin/update_record"
    ...
  end
end
</ruby>

See "Rails Plugin":documentation/rails/index.html for more information.

h3. <font style="color:red;">controller.should_have_rendered</font>

h4. Change "response.should_render" to "controller.should_have_rendered"

In keeping with the separation of controllers and views, we moved should_render from the response
to the controller. This should be a simple search and replace.

<ruby>
context "..." do
  controller_name :...
  
  specify "..." do
    post 'index'
    controller.should_have_rendered :template => "index" #used to be response.should_render
  end
end
</ruby>

h2. Regarding inequality...

You'll notice that the syntax for == and != are different:

<ruby>
actual = 5
actual.should == 5
actual.should_not == 4
</ruby>

We would LOVE to support ...

<ruby>
actual.should != 4
</ruby>

... but we found that while Ruby very generously provides us access to a variety of operational symbols (<, <=, ==, >=, >, and even =~), it does NOT provide us access to "!". So for now, you must use "actual.should_not == value". Patches welcome!
