h2. RSpec on Rails

RSpec comes with a Rails plugin that lets you use RSpec to verify your Rails applications.

h3. Features

* Integrated fixture loading
* Uses many of the controller-test integration features

h3. Installation

The RSpec on Rails plugin is installed via the regular "Rails plugin":http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/Plugins mechanism.

First, you have to tell Rails' plugin mechanism to discover new plugins. Cd to the root of your rails app and run:
<pre>
ruby script/plugin discover
</pre>

Second, install the plugin:
<pre>
ruby script/plugin install rspec_on_rails
</pre>

h3. Examples

After you have installed the plugin, you can write RSpec style specs for both models and controllers:

Model:
<ruby file="../vendor/rails/spec/models/person_spec.rb"/>
