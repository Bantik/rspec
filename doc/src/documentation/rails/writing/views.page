h2. RSpec on Rails - Specifying Views

RSpec on Rails supports the specification of views in complete isolation from their controllers.
This allows you to spec and write your views even before their controllers exist,
or before the related actions have been developed. It also means that bugs introduced
into controllers will not cause view specs to fail.

As noted in the <a href="index.html">introduction</a>, these are great benefits
but they could hide bugs that exist in the interaction between a controller and its
view. We strongly recommend combining these isolated view specs with some sort of
high level integration testing. See <a href="integration.html">integration</a> for
more detail.
