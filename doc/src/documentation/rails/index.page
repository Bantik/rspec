h2. RSpec on Rails - Overview

A Rails plugin that brings RSpec to Rails.

h3. Features

* Use RSpec to verify models, controllers and views
* Integrated fixture loading
* Special generators for models and controllers that generate specs instead of tests.

h3. Naming conventions

When you use Rails without RSpec (with Test::Unit), tests for models end up in tests/unit and tests for controllers
end up in tests/functional.

In order to make things more consistent, RSpec chooses a slightly different naming
convention for directories and Rake tasks. So you will find model specs under
specs/models, controller specs under specs/controllers, and view specs under
specs/views. The Rake tasks are named accordingly.
