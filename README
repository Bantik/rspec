Note to developers:

You may need to run a couple of rake tasks to get things configured
and some deps installed.

See rspec/README for rspec specific items (mostly gems you need to install).

Run "rake install_dependencies" from the project root for rspec_on_rails
specific items (this will download rails versions and plugins that you need
to successfully run "rake pre_commit")
