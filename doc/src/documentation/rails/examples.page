h2. RSpec on Rails - Examples

RSpec on Rails adds several methods to your specs with a look and feel similar to Test::Unit. See for a full description of the "RSpec on Rails Expectation API":rails.html, but here are a few examples:

Model:
<ruby file="../vendor/rspec_on_rails/spec/models/person_spec.rb"/>

Controller:
<ruby file="../vendor/rspec_on_rails/spec/controllers/person_controller_spec.rb"/>

View:
<ruby file="../vendor/rspec_on_rails/spec/views/person/list_view_spec.rb"/>
