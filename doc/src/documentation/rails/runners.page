h2. RSpec on Rails - Runners

h3. Standard spec command

<pre>
spec path/to/my/spec.rb
</pre>

h3. Run specs fast with rails_spec (recommended)

Loading the entire Rails environment every time a spec is executed is quite slow.
We have therefore made a little tool that allows you to load the rails environment
once for all. Open up two shells and run the following in the first:

<pre>
script/rails_spec_server
</pre>

- And then run this in the second:

<pre>
script/rails_spec REGULAR_SPEC_OPTIONS
</pre>

The script/rails_spec script has the same command line interface as the familiar spec
command. But it's MUCH faster.

h3. Running specs with Rake

All specs can be run with

<pre>
rake spec
</pre>

Model specs can be run with

<pre>
rake spec:models
</pre>

Controller specs can be run with

<pre>
rake spec:controllers
</pre>

View specs can be run with

<pre>
rake spec:views
</pre>

To see all the RSpec related tasks, run

<pre>
rake --tasks spec
</pre>
