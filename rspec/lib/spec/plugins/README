This is an experimental attempt at being able to support the mock
framework of your choice. There are no automated tests for this
yet.

We want to support only one mock framework loaded for any process,
so to test this properly, we need to specify that:

1. we can launch separate processes that load the appropriate framework
2. if one framework is already loaded within one process, it should
   complain when there is an attempt to load another
   
The reason for all that is that each framework puts its own methods
on Object to manage stubs. Perhaps we should register/de-register
methods on Object???
