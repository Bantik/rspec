h2. Partial Mocks

RSpec allows you set verifiable expectations for methods on existing Class objects. The
main reason for including this is to support mocking Ruby on Rails model class methods
in controller and/or view specs.

<ruby>
MyModel.should_receive(:find).with(id).and_return(@mock_model_instance)
</ruby>

Mocking (and/or <a href="stubs.html">stubbing</a>) the class level methods and having them return a mock instead of a real instance
of the model class allows you to spec your controllers and views in isolation from the
instance level logic of your model classes. It also helps to keep the context of your
spec completely in view (no having to look at fixtures/xyz.yml to understand what's going on).

Although we haven't completely isolated specs from the
database yet (you still need one for the models to actually work), this sort of mocking
will save you trips to the database, speeding things up quite a bit in a larger app.

Note that as of 0.6.5, this is only supported for Modules (and therefore Classes). It is
not supported for all Objects.
